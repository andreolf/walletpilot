# WalletPilot Documentation

Welcome to the WalletPilot documentation. WalletPilot enables AI agents to execute blockchain transactions on behalf of users with granular permissions and spending limits.

## What is WalletPilot?

WalletPilot is an SDK and API that allows developers to build AI agents that can:

- **Request permissions** from users with specific spending limits
- **Execute transactions** within those approved limits
- **Track usage** via a comprehensive dashboard

## Key Features

- **Granular Permissions** - Define exactly which contracts, tokens, and chains an agent can use
- **Spending Limits** - Set daily, weekly, or total spending caps per token
- **Session Keys** - Based on ERC-7715, no private key sharing required
- **Multi-chain** - Works across Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base
- **Full Audit Trail** - Every transaction logged and visible in your dashboard
